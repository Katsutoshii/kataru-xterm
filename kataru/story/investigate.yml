    Here let's show how we can use state to have nodes that are explorable at most once.
  - goto: Investigate

Investigate:
  - You stand in a room. Before you is a computer, a fridge, and a cup of coffee.
  - Would you like to investigate any of them?
  - choices:
      if not Fridge.visited: { fridge: Fridge }
      if not Coffee.visited: { coffee: Coffee }
      if not Computer.visited: { computer: Computer }
      no: Done
      ...: Done

Coffee:
  - set: { Coffee.visited: true }
  - It's a cup of coffee.
  - goto: Investigate

Fridge:
  - set:
      Fridge.visited: true
      Coffee.visited: true
  - It's a fridge. There's some moldy cheese in there. Gross!
  - goto: Investigate

Computer:
  - set: { Computer.visited: true }
  - It's your computer. Wow, that desktop really needs some organization.
  - goto: Investigate

Done:
  - ALl done exploring, eh? Let's go check out another example then.
  - goto: train:Start
