  - Alice: Hello, my name is Alice. This is how you write a dialogue line in Kataru!
  - Bob: Hi Alice, I'm Bob. Here is another line of dialogue. Isn't it nice how all character names are validated upon parsing?
  - Alice: It sure is, Bob!
  - Bob: Get ready though, soon you'll have to make a choice. Will you continue reading, or stop here?

Timeout:
  - No response, huh?
