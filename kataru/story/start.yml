    Welcome to Kataru!
    「カタル」へようこそ!
    Kataru is a dialogue engine built completely on top of YAML with a focus on ease of implementation and simplicity of writing.

  # Get input from the user and store into variables.
  - input:
      name: What's your name?

  # If you want to ignore whitespace, use `>-`.
  - >-
    Hello ${name},
    are you ready for an epic story?

  # Character dialogue can be done using single-entry maps.
  - Alice: Hello, my name is Alice. This is how you write a dialogue line in Kataru!
  - Bob: Hi Alice, I'm Bob. Here is another line of dialogue. Isn't it nice how all character names are validated upon parsing?
  - Alice: It sure is, Bob!
  - Bob: Get ready though, soon you'll have to make a choice. Will you continue reading, or stop here?

  # Choices are represented as a mapping.
  - choices:
      continue: inv:Start
      stop: End
      ...: Timeout
    timeout: 10

End:
  - End of story. Thanks for playing!
  - goto: Start

Timeout:
  - No response, huh?
  - goto: End
